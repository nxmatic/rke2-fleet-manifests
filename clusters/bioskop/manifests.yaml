                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        relates the key and values.

                                  MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                  spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                  to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                  for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                  MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                  Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                  be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                  MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                  between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                  The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                  or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                  to topologies that satisfy it.
                                  It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                                  We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

          PipelineRun represents a single execution of a Pipeline. PipelineRuns are how
          the graph of Tasks declared in a Pipeline are executed; they specify inputs
          to Pipelines such as parameter values and capture operational aspects of the
          Tasks execution such as service account and tolerations. Creating a
          PipelineRun creates TaskRuns for Tasks in the referenced Pipeline.

                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                  to topologies that satisfy it.

                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                                  We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                  - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                  - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                    but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                    skew.
                                  A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                  if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                  "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:

                                  | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                  If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                  to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                  MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                  won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

                                MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.
                                It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                  must be set in the Secret under the 'ca.crt' key to establish the trust relationship.
                  When connecting to an OCI provider that supports client certificates (mTLS), the client certificate
                  and private key must be set in the Secret under the 'tls.crt' and 'tls.key' keys, respectively.

                      Name defines how the inputs are combined when multiple
                      input provider objects are used. Supported values are:
                      - Flatten: all inputs sets from all input provider objects are
                        flattened into a single list of input sets.
                      - Permute: all inputs sets from all input provider objects are
                        combined using a Cartesian product, resulting in a list of input sets
                        that contains every possible combination of input values.
                        For example, if provider A has inputs [{x: 1}, {x: 2}] and provider B has
                        inputs [{y: "a"}, {y: "b"}], the resulting input sets will be:
                        [{x: 1, y: "a"}, {x: 1, y: "b"}, {x: 2, y: "a"}, {x: 2, y: "b"}].
                        This strategy can lead to a large number of input sets and should be
                        used with caution. Users should use filtering features from
                        ResourceSetInputProvider to limit the amount of exported inputs.

                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                            the spread constraint.
                            - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                            - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                              but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                              skew.
                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                            if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                            "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.
                            It's a required field.

                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                                an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is

== Traefik HelmChartConfig kpt Package

@codebase This package tracks the `+rke2-traefik+` HelmChartConfig used
to expose the built-in RKE2 Traefik deployment during bootstrap. It
replaces the previous cloud-config `+write_files+` manifest so the
configuration now lives in git and is rendered/deployed via
`+rke2-kpt-deploy+`.

=== Usage

[arabic]
. `+kpt pkg get+` this folder into the downstream cluster repo under
`+kpt/system/traefik+`.
. Adjust the Helm values if you need to restrict Traefik exposure (mTLS,
entryPoints, etc.).
. Commit the rendered package and let `+rke2-kpt-package-sync+` mirror
it onto the control-plane node, where the new
`+rke2-traefik-config.service+` applies it automatically.

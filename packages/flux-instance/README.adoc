== Flux Instance kpt Package

This package vendors the upstream Flux Instance Helm chart via the
`+render-helm-chart+` KRM function. Like the Flux Operator package, the
upstream copy only carries sample setters so each cluster can configure
its release name, namespace, and GitRepository sync details downstream
before rendering.

=== Usage

[arabic]
. Fetch the package into the downstream/state repository:

`+@codebase bash kpt pkg get https://github.com/nxmatic/incus-rke2-cluster.git/kpt/system/flux-instance \
    packagevariants/<cluster>/system/flux-instance+`

. Update `+flux-instance-setters.yaml+` (or replace it with a
SOPS-encrypted Secret) to match the environment. Typical edits include
the Flux release namespace, chart version, Flux distribution artifact,
and the GitRepository URL/branch/path that Flux should reconcile.
. Run the render pipeline and commit the rendered manifests so your
GitOps agent (Flux, Config Sync, etc.) can apply them:

`+@codebase bash kpt fn render packagevariants/<cluster>/system/flux-instance+`

. Apply the rendered resources to the cluster. If you want to test
changes via Helm directly before committing, the source chart can also
be installed with:

`+@codebase bash helm upgrade --install flux-instance oci://ghcr.io/controlplaneio-fluxcd/charts/flux-instance \
    --namespace flux-system \
    --create-namespace+`

Remember to keep `+render-helm-chart.yaml+` in sync with upstream
releases whenever the Flux Instance chart is upgraded.

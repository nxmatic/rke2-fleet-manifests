== kubernetes-replicator kpt Package

This package vendors the mittwald kubernetes-replicator Helm chart via
`+render-helm-chart+`. The root copy only ships sample values inside
`+replicator-setters.yaml+`; create a per-cluster clone and override the
setters before rendering.

=== Usage

[arabic]
. `+kpt pkg get+` this folder into the target cluster path of your
downstream/state repo.
. Edit `+replicator-setters.yaml+` (or replace it entirely) to choose
the namespace, release name, and chart version required for that
cluster.
. Run `+kpt fn render+` and commit the rendered resources to the
downstream repo so Flux (or your GitOps agent) applies them at
bootstrap.
